Presentation sections:
  Objectives for the workshop
    * build a simple and useful app
    * stick to "plain" react
    * cover the breadth of react's API
    * shortcut some of the parts which can be frustrating

  Why React?
	Conceptual Model
      Component tree
      Rendering and re-rendering
      The virtual DOM

  A Minimal Component

  Combatting Javascript Fatigue with CRA
    Complexity and Modernity
    Get set up (PRACTICAL)
     - nvm
     - npm install -g create-react-app
     - create-react-app loomap-cluj
     - cd loomap-cluj
     - yarn start
    Strip out the examples

  Components
    "Hello World" (PRACTICAL)
    JSX
      JSX Primer
      Separation of concerns

    Thinking in Components
      Introduce Loomap-Cluj - sketch and data
      What do we need? (WHITEBOARD)

  Props
    Supplying data to components
    Example data
    Loo and LooList (PRACTICAL)

  3rd Party Libs
    Introducing react-leaflet
    Adding little maps (PRACTICAL)
    - yarn add react-leaflet leaflet
    - import the CSS
    - Add a map to each Loo
    - Overcome coordinate reversal
    - Overcome the marker problem :-(
    - Make a multi-marker LooMap (explain bounds)

  State
    How to show the map or the list?
    Introduce stateful components
      Class-based vs function components
      Is it state?
      Initializing state
      conditional rendering based on state
      - install React devTools extension
      setState
      - Build a separate nav component
      - wire the two together (functions as props and onClick!)

  Lifecycle
    How to collect live data from the server?
    The second major feature of class-based React components is that they implement the "Lifecycle methods"
    https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html
    These can seem daunting at first:
        - you can set initial state in constructor()
        - you'll always implement render()
        - data fetching is best done in componentDidMount()
        - componentDidCatch() (new in React 16 - powerful error handling)
        - the rest you can leave for another day (Direct DOM manipulation, performance management etc.)
    Implementing componentDidMount() (PRACTICAL)

  Testing
    - yarn add enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 enzyme-to-json
    Jest
    Enzyme (optional but recommended)
    Snapshots
    coverage

  Form Inputs
    Controlled and Uncontrolled
    Make a filter on name
